    # it is recommended to set `use_thin_strokes` to `false`

    # macOS >= 10.14.x:
    #
    # If the font quality on non-retina display looks bad then set
    # `use_thin_strokes` to `true` and enable font smoothing by running the
    # following command:
    #   `defaults write -g CGFontRenderingFontSmoothingDisabled -bool NO`
